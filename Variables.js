/* Javascript provides eight different data types i.e. null, undefined, string, number, symbol,
object, bigint and boolean*/

//declaring a variable
var myName = "Prabin Joshi";

// The var keyword was used in all JavaScript code from 1995 to 2015.
//The let and const keywords were added to JavaScript in 2015.
let myLastName = "Joshi";

//The biggest problem with 'var' is that you can easily overwrite variable declarations
//'let' solves this problem. It throws an error whenever you try to overwrite a varaible.
